# Activity 1 
   ## If car seat is occupied and heater is ON indicate by turning on a LED using AVR programming
   
### In Action

#### 1. Car seat vacant (button pulled up) and heater switch is off: LED is OFF

#### 2. Car seat vacant and heater switch is on: LED is OFF
![OFF](Simulation/Activity1/2.png)

#### 3. Car seat is occupied (button pushed down) and heater switch is off: LED is OFF
![OFF](Simulation/Activity1/3.jpeg)

#### 4. Car seat is occupied and heater switch is on: LED is turned ON
![ON](Simulation/Activity1/4.jpeg)

# Activity 2
   ## Use Potentiometer as a temperature sensor and convert the Analog values read from the sensor to Digital values
   
### In Action

#### 1. ADC conversion of temperature sensor

# Activity 3 
   ## To obtain PWM signal from a Temperature sensor (Potentiometer)

### In Action

#### 1. PWM signal of Duty cycle (D) = 35%
