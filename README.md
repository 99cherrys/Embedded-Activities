# Embedded C Programming Activities with Continuous Integration and Code Quality

# Activity 1 
   If car seat is occupied and heater is ON indicate by turning on a LED using AVR programming

## In Action

### 1. Car seat vaccant (button pulled up) and heater switch is off
![OFF](Simulation/1.png)

### 2. Car seat vaccant and heater switch is on

### 3. Car seat is occupied (button pushed down) and heater switch is off
![OFF](Simulation/4.jpeg)

### 4. Car seat is occupied and heater switch is on
![ON](Simulation/3.jpeg)
